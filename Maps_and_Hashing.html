<h1>Maps and Hashing</h1>
<h3>John Mieszczanski</h3>
<p>A <b>Map</b> is an abstract data type (ADT) that models a searchable collection of key-value entries. In a Map, multiple
entries with the same key are <u>not</u> allowed. Some applications include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An address book. The name (or business) and address are the key-value pair</li>
    <li>Student record database. The student name could be the key and the value is all the associated data (i.e.
    grade, age, classes, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Another name for a Map is an <u>associative container</u>. The Map ADT is outlined as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Primary Operations:
    <ul>
        <li><code>get(k: Key) -> Value | None</code>
            <ul>
                <li>If a Map M has key k, this operation returns its associated value v; otherwise <code>None</code>
                is returned</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>put(k: Key, v: Value) -> Value | None</code>
            <ul>
                <li>This operation inserts entry (k, v) into Map M. If k is not in M's keys, it returns <code>None</code>
                and if k was already a key before it returns the old value associated with that key</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>remove(k: Key) -> Value | None</code>
            <ul>
                <li>If k is in M's keys, this operation removes (k, v) from M and returns v. Otherwise, if k is not in M,
                <code>None</code> is returned</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Auxiliary Operations:
    <ul>
        <li><code>size() -> int</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Returns the number of key-value pairs in the Map</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>isEmpty() -> bool</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Returns TRUE if there are no key-value pairs in the Map, FALSE otherwise</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>keys() -> Iterable</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Returns an iterable collection of keys in M</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>values() -> Iterable</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Returns an iterable collection of values in M</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>items() -> Iterable</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Returns an iterable collection of (k, v) pairs in M</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If we implement a Map using a list, where each entry in the list is a key-value object then the time complexity of
<code>get()</code> and <code>remove()</code> is going to be O$(n)$ since in the worst case we will have to go through
the whole list to find the (k, v) pair we are looking for. If the list is sorted by keys then <code>put()</code> will
be an O$(n)$ operation since in the worst case we have to do $n$ comparisons. However, if the list is not sorted <code>put()</code>
will just be O$(1)$ since we can just put the new (k, v) pair at the end of the list. However, there is a way to implement
a Map in which all three of those operations will be O$(1)$. To do this, we need to implement the Map as a
<b>direct address table</b>. A direct address table is a Map in which:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Key are in the range $[0, N - 1]$</li>
    <li>Everything is stored in an array A of size $N$</li>
    <li>Entry with key $k$ is stored in A[k]</li>
</ul>
<p>Because we can directly access any (k, v) pair by calling A[k], all three operations in this case will be O$(1)$ time. The
space complexity will be O$(N)$ since we will need $N$ slots regardless of $n$, where $n$ is the number of entries. If you consider
this closely, you will realize that a direct address table is not very efficient unless $n$ and $N$ are close in value. Otherwise,
we have a bunch of empty slots just taking up memory. That's where the idea of <b>hash functions</b> comes into play. If
we have keys not in the range $[0, N - 1]$ then we need to use a hash function to map the keys to table indices in the
address table. In this case, the table becomes a <b>hash table</b> and it consists of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A hash function $h$</li>
    <li>An array A of size $N$</li>
</ul>
<p>The hash function is a mapping of key $k$ onto an index in $[0, N - 1]$. We can think of it as $h(k) \rightarrow [0, N - 1]$.
An example of a hash function would be a modular arithmetic function such as $h(k) = k \text{ mod } N$. The goal of all of
this is to store entries (k, v) at indices $i = h(k)$. Now you might ask yourself, what happens if two different (k, v)
pairs map to the same index $i$. This is called a <b>collision</b>. There are two common solutions to this problem:</p>
<ul>
    <li><u>Chaining</u>: Puts collisions into a linked list (or "bucket")</li>
    <li><u>Open addressing</u>: Upon collision, we use some method to select another location in the hash table</li>
</ul>
<p>When assessing the performance of a hash table, we often consider something called the load factor $\lambda = \frac{n}{N}$,
where $n$ is the number of entries and $N$ is the size of the array. If we pick a hash function $h$ such that the hash
values are random, the <em>expected</em> (average) number of probes for an insertion using open addressing will be:</p>
<p>$$\frac{1}{1 - \lambda} = \frac{1}{1 - n/N} = \frac{1}{(N - n)/N} = \frac{N}{N - n}$$</p>
<p>So the <em>expected</em>, or average, runtime of insertion and all other Map ADT operations will be O$(1)$. Note carefully
that this is only the average runtime. The worst-case runtime is still going to be O$(n)$ since it is still technically possible to
have the maximum number of collisions even with a randomizing hash function. Also note that the closer that $\lambda$ is to
1, the better performance we can expect. If $\frac{n}{N} << 1$ then we are wasting space, and if $\frac{n}{N} >> 1$ we will
have too many collisions. The former wastes space, the latter wastes time.</p>
<p>During this semester, we implemented a hash table using a Python dictionary in order to efficiently find if for a given an integer
$n$ and list of integers $L$, any integers in $L$ summed to $n$. We then compared our solution to one in which we find possible
sums using a double for-loop (O$(n^2)$) to see which was faster. As expected, the hash table was much more efficient as we
increased the size of $L$, because on average the hash table could conduct its operations in O$(1)$ time. Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code class="python">from typing import List
from time import perf_counter
import random


# Returns all pairs of integers that sum to number parameter
def two_sum_hash(int_list: List[int], number: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    sums = []
    hash_table = {}

    # We check each integer in the list
    for i in range(len(int_list)):
        # We want to see if the number parameter minus the current number in the list is also in the list
        sum_minus_element = number - int_list[i]

        # Check if sum_minus_element is already in the hash_table
        if str(sum_minus_element) in hash_table:
            # If sum_minus_element is in the hash table, then element + sum_minus_element is a valid sum
            sums.append([int_list[i], sum_minus_element])

        # Add current element to the hash table
        hash_table[str(int_list[i])] = int_list[i]

    # Returns all integer pairs that sum to number parameter
    return sums


def two_sum_dbl_loop(int_list: List[int], number: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    sums = []

    for i in range(len(int_list)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(int_list)):
            # print(str(i) + ' ' + str(j))
            if int_list[i] + int_list[j] == number:
                sums.append([int_list[i], int_list[j]])

    return sums</code></pre>
<p>and here is the test of the code:</p>

<p>Some other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Uses">applications</a> of hash tables caches. A cache
is an auxiliary data table with limited space that is used to speed up access to data that is primarily stored in slower
media. In most implementations, hash collisions are handled by discarding the older of the two colliding entries. This ensures
every item in the table has a unique hash value, and also means that the data in the cache will be data the has been used more
recently. The fact that each item in the table will have a unique hash value ensures that the table will be operating
as efficiently as possible, provided that $\lambda \approx 1$, which is generally the case with caches.</p>

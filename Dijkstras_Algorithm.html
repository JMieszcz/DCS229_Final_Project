<h1>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h1>
<h3>John Mieszczanski</h3>
<p><b>Dijkstra's algorithm</b> is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between any two nodes in a graph. It was developed
by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956, hence its namesake. Before diving into the algorithm, let's cover some
graph terminology. A graph consists of a set of <b>edges</b> and a set of <b>vertices</b>, where edges are pairings of vertices that
are connected. If the graph is not directed, then the edges consist of <em>unordered</em> pairs, but if the graph is directed,
the edges consist of ordered pairs to reflect the direction of the connection of the two vertices. Here are some ways we can
describe edges:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An edge is described as <u>incident on</u> its endpoints (i.e. the vertices it is connected to)</li>
    <li>A <u>loop</u> is an edge the emanates and terminates on the same vertex</li>
    <li>Two distinct edges are called <u>parallel</u> if they share the same endpoints</li>
    <li>Two distinct edges are called <u>adjacent</u> if they share a common endpoint</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are some ways to describe vertices:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Two vertices are <u>adjacent</u> if they share a common edge</li>
    <li>A vertex if <u>adjacent to self</u> if has a loop edge connected to itself</li>
    <li>A vertex is <u>isolated</u> if it has no associated edge</li>
    <li>The <u>degree</u> of a vertex is the number of edges incident on that vertex
    <ul>
        <li>The total <u>degree</u> of a graph is the sum $\Sigma deg(v_i)$ of the number of edges across all vertices</li>
        <li>Note that $\Sigma deg(v_i) = 2|E|$ where $|E|$ is the number of edges</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>A common way to represent a graph abstractly (which we need to do on a computer) is to use an adjacency matrix $A$.
Here are some properties of an arbitrary adjacency matrix $A$ representing graph $G$:</p>
<ul>
    <li>$A$ is an $n$ x $n$ matrix where $n$ is the number of vertices</li>
    <li>Every entry $a_{ij}$ is the number of edges from $v_i$ to $v_j$
        <pre><code class="plaintext">for (i = 0 ; i < n ; i++)
    for (j = 0 ; j < n ; j++)
        if ({v_i, v_j} in E)  # {v_i, v_j} is an edge connecting v_i and v_j and E is the set of all edges of G
            A[i][j] += 1</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>$A$ is symmetric for undirected graphs</li>
    <li>$A$ is symmetric for digraph only when $G$ is complete</li>
    <li>$A^m$ (matrix multiplication) gives the number of paths of length $m = 1, 2, 3, ... , n$
    <ul>
        <li>If $A^k(i,j) \neq 0$ for any $k$, then vertex $v_j$ is reachable from $v_i$</li>
        <li>Each matrix multiplication is O$(n^3)$ and we need $n - 1$ matrix multiplications so determining
        reachability with this process is O$(n^4)$ (not very good!). There are much better ways to determine
        reachability, such as using BFS (O$(n)$)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The approach of Dijkstra's algorithm is outlined as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>From the starting vertex, find the shortest path (via edge) to the closest vertex</li>
    <li>From the new vertex, find the shortest path (via edge or through previous vertex) to next closest
    vertex</li>
    <li>repeat the above process</li>
    <li>Find shortest path (via edge or through $\geq 1$ of the previous vertices) to the destination/goal vertex</li>
</ul>
<p>Dijkstra's algorithm works because the shortest path to any arbitrary vertex $v_i$ must be a direct route (edge), or
it must pass through vertices of paths already considered.</p>
<p>Here is pseudocode sketch implementing Dijkstra's algorithm:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext">d = [infinity] * |V|  # |V| is the number of vertices. This list shows the cost of going from
# v_origin (origin vertex) to all the other vertices. We start by setting each value to infinity, which represents
# all vertices being unreachable initially
d[v_orig] = 0  # It takes zero cost to go from v_orig to itself
U = {v_orig}  # U is the set of "visited" vertices. Initially, v_orig is the only "visited" vertex
u = v_orig  # u is always the most recently added vertex

while u != v_dest:  # we want this loop to stop once the destination vertex is added
    # update distances
    for all v_i not in U:  # we consider only unvisited vertices:
        if v_i is adjacent to u:  # use adjacency matrix here to determine this
            d[v_i] = min(d[v_i], d[u] + len({u, v_i}))
            # This is determining whether adding u gives a shorter/cheaper path to v_i by first going through
            # u (with cost d[u]) and then along the {u, v_i} edge. It is comparing the new path to v_i to the old
            # path of v_i if one exists, and then taking the minimum
        # find the next closest vertex to v_orig. We pick the unvisited vertex having the minimum distance from v_orig
        # and then adding it to U
        min_dist = infinity
        for all v_i not in U:
            if d[v_i] < min_dist:  # consider only "unvisited" vertices
                u = v_i
                min_dist = d[v_i]
        U = U.append(u)  # add vertex u to set U (it is now considered "visited"</code></pre>
<p>The algorithm outlined above will find the length of the shortest path from the origin vertex to the goal vertex, but it does
not provide that path explicitly. However, this certainly does not mean you can't implement Dijsktra's algorithm with
the path given as well, it just takes some extra bookkeeping. In terms of time complexity, if we implement the
algorithm using an adjacency matrix and array of vertices U, as we have done above, the running time is O$(|E| + |V|^2)$
in the worst case, where $|E|$ is the number of edges, and $|V|$ the number of vertices. The reason for this is that for
each vertex $v_i$ we need to compare it distance to all its neighboring vertices, which means in the worst case be have
$|V| \cdot |V| = |V|^2$ comparisons in the worst case. We also need to explore all edges $E$ once, so this is where the
$|E|$ term comes from. Note that O$(|E| + |V|^2)$ can be reduced to O$(|V|^2)$ = O$(n^2)$.</p>
<p>A Python implementation of Dijsktra's algorithm is outlined below:</p>

<pre><code>def main():

<p>we might get something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext">    0  1  2  3  4  5
 0  âˆž  7  âˆž  2  âˆž  âˆž
 1  7  âˆž  2  âˆž  3  âˆž
 2  âˆž  2  âˆž  âˆž  âˆž  4
 3  2  âˆž  âˆž  âˆž  1  âˆž
 4  âˆž  3  âˆž  1  âˆž 10
 5  âˆž  âˆž  4  âˆž 10  âˆž
---------------------
Enter a starting vertex ('q' to quit): 0
Enter a destination vertex ('q' to quit): 5
The shortest path from 0 to 5 is length 12
Enter a starting vertex ('q' to quit): 1
Enter a destination vertex ('q' to quit): 3
The shortest path from 1 to 3 is length 4
Enter a starting vertex ('q' to quit): q
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we have basic 6x6 graph that is implemented as an adjacency matrix. The <code>main()</code> function
allows us to use the algorithm to find the shortest distance between any two valid vertices on the graph. It only gives
the distance between those points, not the path itself. It is possible to implement this with the path, but this exercise
was designed to be a basic example.</p>
<p>There are many, many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#Applications">applications</a> of Dijkstra's
algorithm in the real world. For example, we might want to find the least cost path when building oil pipelines, electricity lines,
or railroads. These would all have to take into account different costs such as terrain, distance, price, etc. that could be
factored into an implementation. One could develop a sort of equation accounting for all these factors, so they wouldn't have to
run Dijkstra's algorithm for each individual cost parameter. The algorithm has also been used to determine optimal long-distance
footpaths in Ethiopia to see how people's natural tendencies matches up with what is the mathematically "optimal" route. This could
provide an interesting study on human intuition, and it also could reveal potential costs that the algorithm has not taken into
account, but humans have.</p>

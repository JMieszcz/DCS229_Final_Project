<h1>Binary Search Trees</h1>
<h3>John Mieszczanski</h3>
<p>A <b>Binary Search Tree (BST)</b> is a binary tree $T$ with each node $n$ storing a key-value pair (k, v) such that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keys in the left subtree of $n$ are less than $k$</li>
    <li>Keys in the right subtree of $n$ are greater than $k$</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to any sort of binary tree, there are several ways to traverse the tree:</p>
<ul>
    <li><u>Preorder traversal</u>: Node $n$ visited before its descendants</li>
    <li><u>Postorder traversal</u>: Node $n$ visited after its descendants</li>
    <li><u>Inorder traversal</u>: Node $n$ visited after traversing its left subtree, but before traversing its
    right subtree</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to BSTs, we traverse the tree with an inorder traversal. Because of how BSTs are defined, this means
we will visit nodes in an increasing order of keys. Also, the time complexity will be O$(n)$ since in a tree with
$n$ nodes, we visit all nodes in a traversal. We can implement an inorder traversal of a BST using recursion as shown
below:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext">def in_order(p: TreeNode):
    if p has left child:
        in_order(left_child)
    visit p
    if p has right child:
        in_order(right_child)</code></pre>
<p>Visiting all the nodes of a BST is nice, but we want to actually be able to search for a specific key $k$ in a BST. A
pseudocode algorithm for searching that uses recursion is shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext">def bst_search(T: BinaryTree, p: TreeNode, k):
    if p's key == k: return p
    elif k < p's key and p has left child:
        return bst_search(T, p's left child, k)
    elif k > p's key and p has right child:
        return bst_search(T, p's right child, k)
    else: return None   # If we reach this point, key k was not found</code></pre>
<p>The above algorithm works because if we go down the left or right subtree of a given node, we don't need to worry
about the keys of the nodes from the other subtree being less (if we went down left subtree) or greater (if we went down
right subtree) than the value we are looking for, so we will have essentially halved our search space. Because of this
the time complexity of searching a BST in O$(\text{log } n)$ if the tree is balanced. To clarify, if we have a tree of
height $h$ with $n$ entries and the BST is <em>complete</em> (see discussion of heaps), then $h = \lfloor \text{log} n \rfloor$
which means the search will be O$(\text{log } n)$. If the tree is not balanced (i.e. not <em>complete</em>), then the
time complexity will be O$(n)$ in the worst case because it is possible all the nodes tack on to the right (or left) in
which case the tree is effectively a sorted list. There are many tree rotation operations that can be implemented in
order to maintain the balance of a BST as new nodes are added.</p>
<p>Lastly, let's take a look at some pseudocode for a BST insertion algorithm:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext">def insert(T: BinaryTree, key, value):
    p = bst_search(T, k)  # If not found by BST search, assume the function returns the last node encountered in
    # the search
    if p's key == k: replace old value with given value
    elif k < p's key:
        add node (k,v) as left child of p
    else:
        add node (k,v) as right child of p</code></pre>
<p>This algorithm works because if bst_search() does not find the key, it will leave us off at whatever location where
we would have <em>expected</em> to find the key, so it is trivial to insert the key and its value at that location. Insertion
has the same time complexity as search because we have to call search to get insertion to work.</p>
<p>One of the main <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree#Examples_of_applications">applications</a> of BSTs
is to implement sorting algorithms in an efficient manner. In such an implementation, a series of elements (probably numbers, maybe
with associated data i.e. key-value pair) would be passed into the BST and sorted using the <code>insert</code> operation. If
we wanted to read off the elements of the BST in order, we could perform an inorder traversal. As mentioned before, it is
possible that this could lead to a heavily unbalanced tree, reducing efficiency. This is why some types of BSTs, such as
AVL trees and red-black trees are implemented in a way that makes them self-balancing. In other words, these types of BSTs
try to keep the height $h$ of the tree to a minimum in order to keep the time complexity as close to O$(\text{log } n)$
as possible.</p>

<h1>Heaps</h1>
<h3>John Mieszczanski</h3>
<p>A heap is a binary tree T that satisfies the following two conditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There is a relational property on the way keys are stored in T</li>
    <li>There is a structural property in terms of the shape of T itself</li>
</ul>
<p>What is a binary tree you might ask? Well, a binary tree is simply just another data structure like an array or linked
list. It is type of tree, where a tree is a set of nodes storing elements such that the nodes have a
parent-child relationship satisfying:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the tree is non-empty, the tree has a root node that has no parent</li>
    <li>Each node of the tree different from the root has a unique parent</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible for a tree to be empty. A binary tree is an ordered tree with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Every node has at most two children</li>
    <li>Each child node is labeled as a left child or a right child</li>
    <li>A left child precedes a right child in the ordering of children</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is some terminology associated with binary trees:</p>
<ul>
    <li><u>left subtree</u>: subtree rooted at left child</li>
    <li><u>right subtree</u>: subtree rooted at right child</li>
    <li><u>proper</u>: binary tree in which each node has zero or two children</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have fleshed out some background on binary trees, let's talk about the relational property of a heap,
also known as the "heap order property". What this means is that in a heap, for every node other than the root,
the key stored at that node is greater than or equal to the key stored at that node's parent. As a result, the keys
encountered from root to leaf are non-decreasing and the minimum key is always found at the root. Let's also consider
the structural property of the heap, also known as the "complete binary tree property". This property means that for a
heap T with height $h$ having levels $0,1,...h-1$ of T, each level has the maximum number of nodes possible. The remaining
nodes at level $h$ reside at the leftmost possible positions. an easy way to determining the height $h$ of a heap with
$n$ entries is to calculate $h = \lfloor \text{log} n \rfloor$ (i.e. use the floor function).</p>
<p>There are two operations that we might want to conduct on a heap:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>insert(k, v)</code>
    <ul>
        <li>Insert a key-value pair into the heap</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><code>remove_min()</code>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the minimum value (root) from the heap</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>When conducting both of these operations, we have to ensure both the heap order property and the complete binary tree
property remain satisfied. Let's start with outlining a series of steps for inserting a node with key-value pair (k, v):</p>
<ol>
    <li>Insert the node in the leftmost position on level $h$</li>
    <li>Compare the newly inserted node with its parent. If the newly inserted node is larger, swap it with it parent.</li>
    <li>Continue with step 2 until the heap order property is restored</li>
</ol>
<p>From the process outlined above, steps 2 and 3 are known as <b>up-heap bubbling</b>. Next, let's outline the process
for removing the minimum node with key-value pair (k, v):</p>
<ol>
    <li>Replace the root node with the last leaf node on level $h$</li>
    <li>Compare the replacement against its children. If one of the children is smaller,
        swap the replacement with the smallest child</li>
    <li>Repeat step 2 until the heap order property is restored</li>
</ol>
<p>From the process outlined above, steps 2 and 3 are known as <b>down-heap bubbling</b>.</p>
<p>Now that we have outlined the two processes key to the heap data structure; insertion and deletion, let's consider
their time complexity. When inserting an element into the heap, the worst case scenario is that we have bubble all the
way up to the root. This would take $h$ comparisons, where $h$ is the height of the tree. Because $h = \lfloor \text{log} n \rfloor$,
it follows that insertion is O$(log n)$. Similarly, deletion is O$(log n)$ as well because in the worst case we have to
bubble all the way down to level $h$, requiring $h$ comparisons.</p>
<p>In the Priority Queue document, we showed an implementation of a Priority Queue that used heaps. Let's take another
look at this code:</p>
<pre><code>from typing import Generic, List, TypeVar
T = TypeVar("T")  # allows variable T to be used to represent a generic type

from heapq import *
import random
import string


class Entry(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, priority: 'float|str', data: T):
        self._key   = priority
        self._value = data

    # Need to be able to compare keys of entries in order to determine priority. Also necessary
    # because we are implementing using a heap
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self._key == other._key and self._value == other._value

    # Need to be able to compare keys of entries in order to determine priority. Also necessary
    # because we are implementing using a heap
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self._key < other._key

    # not the Pythonic way to use __repr__ but allows us to print list of Entry
    def __repr__(self):
        key = f"'{self._key}'"   if isinstance(self._key,   str) else f"{self._key}"
        val = f"'{self._value}'" if isinstance(self._value, str) else f"{self._value}"
        return f"({key},{val})"

    def __str__(self):
        return repr(self)


class PriorityQueue(Generic[T]):
    __slots__ = ('_container')

    def __init__(self):
        self._container: List[T] = list()

    def __len__(self): return len(self._container)

    def is_empty(self): return len(self._container) == 0

    def insert(self, key: 'float|str', item: T) -> None:
        e = Entry(key, item)
        heappush(self._container, e) # in by priority/key

    def remove_min(self) -> Entry:
        return heappop(self._container) # out by priority/key</code></pre>
<p>This Priority Queue is implemented using the heap data structure via the <code>heapq</code> module. The two main operations
to note are <code>heappush()</code> and <code>heappop()</code> which are essentially just the insertion and deletion we
discussed above. Because we defined a priority relationship with our keys (less-than and equal-to), these two heap operations
are able to implement the two algorithms sketched out above under the hood of the module.</p>
<p>As was made clear in the document discussing the Priority Queue, one of the main
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)#Applications">applications</a> of the heap is to implement the
Priority Queue. The part that makes it useful in this matter is the heap order property. Without this property, the heap
would not be useful as we would not be able to guarantee we are popping of the minimum (or maximum) element. Other applications include
selection algorithms (i.e. minimum or maximum integer) as we can draw off the minimum element (at the root) or the maximum element (if we implemented a
maximum heap instead of a minimum heap) in constant time.</p>

<h1>Object Oriented Programming & Classes</h1>
<h3>John Mieszczanski</h3>
<p>Per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a
    programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects",
    which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties),
    and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).</blockquote>
<p>In languages such as Python, C++, and Java, all data items are
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)">objects</a>, so these languages are referred to
    as <em>object-oriented</em> programming languages. In any of these languages we can create an object by defining a
    class (or using a built-in class/type, such as <code class="python">int</code> in Python) and then assigning a
    variable to an instance of that class.</p>
<p> What is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)">class</a> you might ask? Well a
    class is just a template/method for creating an object in any of the OOP languages already mentioned. The main
    features of a class are a constructor that initiates an instance of the class with the relevant data/variables, and
    a set of methods that defines the behavior of the class. These methods allow one to operate on an instance of the
    class or the entire class itself. Additionally, variables of a class (the data) are either <em>instance</em>
    variables, which are relevant to only a specific instance of the class, and <em>class</em> variables which are
    shared by all instances of a class of the same type. An example of a class is outlined in pseudocode below:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext">class Dog{
    string name;
    string color;
    float age;
    int counter;

    counter = 0

    # Creates an instance of the Dog class
    constructor(string name, string color, float age){
        name = name;
        fur_color = color;
        age = age;
        counter += 1;
    }

    # Some Dog class methods outlined below...
    string get_name(){
        return name;
    }

    string get_color(){
            return color;
        }

    float get_age(){
            return age;
        }

    # Returns age of dog in dog years
    float dog_years(){
        return age * 15;
    }
}

int main(){
    float human_age, dog_age;
    string name, color;
    # Create two instances of Dog
    Clifford = Dog("Clifford", "Red", 12);
    Sally = Dog("Sally", "Brown", 5);
    print(Dog.counter);
    # Access the age instance variable from Clifford
    human_age = Clifford.get_age();
    # Use the dog_years() method to get the age in dog years
    # from Clifford
    dog_age = Clifford.dog_years();
    # Access the name instance variable from Clifford
    name = Clifford.get_name();
    print(human_age);
    print(name);
    # Access the color instance variable from Sally
    color = Sally.get_color();
    print(color);

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>In the above pseudocode example, we have a <code>Dog</code> class with three input parameters. We create an instance
    of this class by calling <pre><code class="plaintext">Clifford = Dog("Clifford", "Red", 12);</code></pre> This initiates
    the <code>constructor()</code> method which assigns the three parameters to the <em>instance</em> variables
    <code class="plaintext">name</code>, <code class="plaintext">color</code>, and
    <code  class="plaintext">age</code> which are special to the <code class="plaintext">Clifford</code> instance. We
    also have the <em>class</em> variable <code>counter</code> which increments by one every time we create a new
    instance of the <code>Dog</code> class. Therefore,</p>
    <pre><code class="plaintext">Clifford = Dog("Clifford", "Red", 12);
Sally = Dog("Sally", "Brown", 5);
print(Dog.counter);</code></pre><p>prints 2 because we have created two instances. This <code>counter</code> class variable
    can be accessed by any instance of <code>Dog</code>, or
    by calling <code>Dog.counter</code> (i.e. directly accessing the class type). The <code>main()</code> function
    demonstrates how we can use methods on instances of <code>Dog</code>. For example, <code>Clifford.get_age()</code>
    accesses the <code>age</code> instance variable for the <code>Clifford</code> instance.</p>
<p>A slightly more complicated example of a class is outlined below. In this example, a <code>Student</code> class is created
    in Python:</p>
<pre><code class="python">class Student:
    __slots__ = ("fname", "lname", "class_")
    # class variable
    counter = 0

    def __init__(self, fname, lname, class_):
        # instance variables
        self.fname = fname
        self.lname = lname
        self.class_ = class_
        counter += 1

    # Checks if two instances of Student are equal
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.fname == other.fname and self.lname == other.lname

    # Allows one to print a Student instance
    def __str__(self):
        return self.fname + " " + self.lname + " " + str(self.class_)

    def setFirstName(self, fname):
        self.fname = fname

    def setLastName(self, lname):
        self.lname = lname

    def get_fname(self):
        return self.fname

    def get_lname(self):
        return self.lname

    def get_class(self):
        return self.class_</code></pre>
<pre><code class="python">>>> john = Student("John", "Mieszczanski", 4)
>>> tom = Student("Tom", "Smith", 4)
>>> adrian = Student("Adrian", "Lemere", 3)
>>> print(adrian.__str__())
Adrian Lemere 3
>>> print(tom)
Tom Smith 4
>>> print(john)
John Mieszczanski 4
>>> adrian.setFirstName("Yo Adrian")
>>> print(adrian)
Yo Adrian Lemere 3
>>> print(tom == adrian)
False
>>> print(adrian == adrian)
True
>>> mashup = Student("Tom", "Smith", 1)
>>> print(tom == mashup)
True</code></pre>
<p>In the above Python code snippet, we create a <code>Student</code> class. The constructor for this class is given
    by</p><pre><code>def __init__(self, fname, lname, class_):
        # instance variables
        self.fname = fname
        self.lname = lname
        self.class_ = class_
        counter += 1</code></pre><p>Every time we create a new <code>Student</code> instance, we initialize three
instance variables from the three parameters and increment the class variable <code>counter</code> by one so we can
track how many instances of <code>Student</code> we have. Each instance variable requires the prefix <code>self</code>,
which is a feature unique to Python. Additionally, the <code>class_</code> instance variable has an underscore to indicate
it should not be mutable. We also define an <code>__eq__</code> method that defines if two instances are equivalent
or not. This method is demonstrated using the Python interpreter in the code below the class. The <code>__str__</code>
method defines how an instance of <code>Student</code> is printed. Lastly, we have methods for changing the first and
last names of a given <code>Student</code> instance, and methods that allow us to access information about a given
<code>Student</code>.</p>
<p>One might ask "Why use OOP and classes when we can just use functions?"
The article <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/09/02/if-everyone-hates-it-why-is-oop-still-so-widely-spread/">
If everyone hates it, why is OOP still so widely spread?</a> helps us answer this question. The main advantage
highlighted by the article is <em>encapsulation</em>. What is <em>encapsulation</em>? Well, it is essentially the
idea in OOP that data and methods are <em>encapsulated</em> within an object and thus we can control how that data is
accessed with our methods. As the article notes, this allows us to protect data that we do not want changed. The abstraction
inherent to OOP also allows a user to access and manipulate data without having to know what is going on underneath the
hood. This allows for people with a far greater range of abilities to write useful code. Inheritance and polymorphism
are also inherent to OOP and discussed in this article, but those concepts will be covered in a separate

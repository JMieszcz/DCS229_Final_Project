<h1>Inheritance & Polymorphism</h1>
<h3>John Mieszczanski</h3>
<p>Two important features of <a href="/Users/John1/Documents/DCS229/Final_Project/OOP_and_Classes.html">OOP</a> are
<em>Inheritance</em> and <em>Polymorphism</em>. Inheritance is the idea that if there is some subclass of a parent class,
that subclass <em>inherits</em> all the data and methods from its direct parent. To think of this more abstractly, we can
identify a natural vertical progression of downward specialization (upward generalization) among mammals:</p>
<ul>
    <li>mammal &#8594 feline &#8594 domestic cat</li>
    <li>mammal &#8594 feline &#8594 lion</li>
    <li>mammal &#8594 bovine &#8594 water buffalo</li>
    <li>mammal &#8594 bovine &#8594 bison</li>
</ul>
<p>In the above example, we can think of the parent class as <em>mammal</em>. The feline, bovine, domestic cat, lion,
water buffalo, and bison classes all <em>inherit</em> the properties (i.e. fundamental data and methods) of the mammal class.
For example, all of these subclasses would have hair or fur, as this is a property inherited from being a subclass of mammal.
Furthermore, the domestic cat and lion classes <em>inherit</em> the properties of the feline class (e.g. having claws)
and the water buffalo and bison <em>inherit</em> the properties of the bovine class (e.g. having hooves). As one can see,
the properties of the subclasses <em>cascade</em> down from their parent class(es).</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a Python example of inheritance:</p>
<pre><code class="python">import math

# Parent Class
class Shape:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self._name = name
    self._area = 0
  def __str__(self):
    return self._name + " : " + str(self._area)

# Subclass
class Triangle(Shape):
  def __init__(self, name, b, h):
    super().__init__(name)
    self._base = b
	self._height = h
    self._area = (b * h) / 2
  def get_perimeter(self):
    b = self._base
    h = self._height
    return b + h + math.sqrt(b*b + h*h)

# Subclass
class Circle(Shape):
  def __init__(self, name, r):
    super().__init__(name)
    self._radius = r
    self._area = math.pi * r**2
  def get_perimeter(self):
    return 2 * math.pi * self._radius</code></pre>
<pre><code>>>> s = Shape("blob")
>>> c = Circle("roundish", 2)
>>> t = Triangle("pointy", 2, 3)
>>> isinstance(s, Shape)
True
>>> isinstance(c, Shape)
True
>>> isinstance(s, Circle)
False
>>> isinstance(c, Circle)
True
>>> t.get_perimeter()
8.60555127546399
>>> print(t)
pointy : 3.0
>>> c.get_perimeter()
12.566370614359172</code></pre>
<p>As we can see from the code blocks above, <code>Shape</code> is the parent class and <code>Triangle</code> and
<code>Circle</code> are two subclasses. Both <code>Triangle</code> and <code>Circle</code> <em>inherit</em> the
<code>__str__()</code> method from <code>Shape</code> which defines how one prints an instance of either class. Within both
of the subclasses, we have a <code>get_perimeter()</code> method which gives us the perimeter of the respective shape. It
is important to note that when we create a subclass in Python we include the parent as a parameter when drawing up the
blueprint of the class:</p>
<pre><code>class Triangle(Shape):</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, the <code>super()</code> function in Python is used to give access to methods and properties of the parent class</p>
<pre><code>class Circle(Shape):
  def __init__(self, name, r):
    super().__init__(name)
    self._radius = r
    self._area = math.pi * r**2
  def get_perimeter(self):
    return 2 * math.pi * self._radius</code></pre>
<p>In the above code snippet, <code>super()</code> is used to initialize the <code>_name</code> instance variable which
is inherited from the parent class <code>Shape</code>.</p>

<p>The second concept we need to discuss is <em>polymorphism</em>. Per
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Polymorphism is the provision of a single
    interface to entities of different types</blockquote>
<p>In practice, this might mean we have some function that can act on different classes that share methods and/or
instance variables. For example:</p>
<pre><code>def process_shape(shape):
   print(shape)  # call __str__
   print(type(shape))
   print(shape.get_perimeter())

c = Circle("roundish", 2)
t = Triangle("pointy", 2, 3)
process_shape(c) # Circle's get_perim
process_shape(t) # Triangle's get_perim</code></pre>
<p>defines a polymorphism function <code>process_shape()</code> which can take in any shape (such as <code>Circle</code>
and <code>Triangle</code> which has a <code>__str__()</code> and <code>get_perimeter()</code> method. If these conditions
are satisfied, Python can dynamically determine the type of object passed to the function and call the respective methods
on said object. From this, we can clearly see that <code>process_shape()</code> fits the definition of being a <em>provision of a single
        interface to entities of different types.</em></p>
<p>In the OOP document, we covered part of the article
<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/09/02/if-everyone-hates-it-why-is-oop-still-so-widely-spread/">
If everyone hates it, why is OOP still so widely spread?</a> which discusses some of the benefits (and limitations) of OOP
that have made it a popular paradigm. The article mentions inheritance as a key feature of OOP as it allows one to easily
reuse code on objects of different, but related (i.e. parent class and subclass) types. It also notes how polymorphism
is often not possible without inheritance. This makes sense as a polymorphism must be able to act on different classes with shared
features (such as a <code>get_perimeter()</code> method in the example above), and these shared features are often the
result of inheritance from a parent class. While the article points out that polymorphism is not a concept limited to OOP, it is a
fundamental aspect of the paradigm that makes it easy manipulate related, but different classes.</p>
